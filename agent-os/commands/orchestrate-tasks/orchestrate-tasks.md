# Process for Orchestrating Product Implementation

Orchestrate implementation across ALL specs/phases in parallel from project root.

**Run this from PROJECT ROOT, not from a spec folder.**

## Multi-Phase Process

### FIRST: Verify Beads and Get All Phases


### NEXT: Analyze Parallel Execution Opportunities

Use BV to identify which work can run in parallel across ALL phases:


### NEXT: Create Orchestration Plan


### NEXT: Assign atomic design agents to work


### NEXT: Choose Execution Mode (Parallel or Sequential)




### NEXT: Delegate implementations to assigned subagents
