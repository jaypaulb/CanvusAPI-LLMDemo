I want you to create a tasks breakdown from a given spec and requirements for a new feature using the following MULTI-PHASE process and instructions.

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names.  Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

# PHASE 1: Get Spec Requirements

The FIRST STEP is to make sure you have ONE OR BOTH of these files to inform your tasks breakdown:
- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`
- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/requirements.md`

IF you don't have ONE OR BOTH of those files in your current conversation context, then ask user to provide direction on where to you can find them by outputting the following request then wait for user's response:

"I'll need a spec.md or requirements.md (or both) in order to build a tasks list.

Please direct me to where I can find those.  If you haven't created them yet, you can run /shape-spec or /write-spec."
