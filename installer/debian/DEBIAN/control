Description: Local AI integration service for Canvus
 CanvusLocalLLM connects Canvus collaborative workspaces with local AI
 services via llama.cpp ecosystem. It monitors canvas widgets in real-time,
 processes AI prompts enclosed in {{ }}, and handles PDF analysis, canvas
 analysis, and image generation using embedded multimodal models with
 cloud fallback support.
 .
 Features:
  - Real-time canvas monitoring
  - AI prompt processing
  - PDF analysis and summarization
  - Local image generation with Stable Diffusion (CUDA accelerated)
  - Handwriting recognition
 .
 Hardware Requirements for Image Generation:
  - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (RTX 20xx/30xx/40xx recommended)
  - Minimum 8GB GPU memory for optimal performance
  - CUDA Toolkit 11.0 or later
